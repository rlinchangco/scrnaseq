## Introduction
The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.

## Documentation

The nf-core/scrnaseq pipeline comes with documentation about the pipeline, found in the `docs/` directory:

1. [Installation](https://nf-co.re/usage/installation)
2. Pipeline configuration
    * [Local installation](https://nf-co.re/usage/local_installation)
    * [Adding your own system config](https://nf-co.re/usage/adding_own_config)
    * [Reference genomes](https://nf-co.re/usage/reference_genomes)
3. [Running the pipeline](docs/usage.md)
4. [Output and how to interpret the results](docs/output.md)
5. [Troubleshooting](https://nf-co.re/usage/troubleshooting)

## Citation

You can cite the `nf-core` pre-print as follows:

The basic benchmarks that were used as motivation for incorporating the three available modular workflows based on Kallisto+Bustools, STARsolo and Salmon Alevin / AlevinQC were all benchmarked in [this publication](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/673285v2).

We offer all three paths for the processing of scRNAseq data so it remains up to the user to decide which pipeline workflow is chosen for a particular analysis question.
